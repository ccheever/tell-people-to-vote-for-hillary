  `I'm reaching out to friends who live in swing states to remind them to register to vote because your vote counts for a lot. Would you check your registration status at voteplz.org (http://voteplz.org/) before the October 11th deadline passes?

Since this election is so important, I hope you don't mind that I check in again if I don't hear back.`,
